          <p><strong>Community Nicknames:</strong> Scalpel, Unevolved Dissector</p>
          <p><strong>Danger Level:</strong> Moderate</p>

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>Scalpels are considered the less developed, unevolved form of the Dissector species. They share a similar humanoid structure but are weaker and less imposing, with wiry limbs and blades that are less refined compared to their evolved counterparts.</p>
          <p>Their bladed appendages are shorter but still sharp enough to deal significant damage. Like the Dissectors, they possess erratic movement patterns and varying head shapes, including some with horn-like protrusions.</p>

          <h3>Behavior</h3>
          <p>Scalpels are aggressive but less calculated than Dissectors. Once a Scalpel has spotted a player, it will chase them relentlessly.</p>
          <p>A key behavior of the Scalpel is its tendency to lunge at targets. This lunge is powerful, but if it misses and hits a wall, the Scalpel will be temporarily stunned, giving players an opportunity to escape or attack.</p>

          <h3>General Information</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Can make a short forward rush.</li>
            <li>If it hits a wall during a lunge, it becomes stunned for a few seconds.</li>
            <li><em>Additional data to be filled out.</em></li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Countermeasures</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Dodge its lunges to force it into walls, stunning it momentarily.</li>
            <li>Avoid tight, open spaces where it can quickly close the distance.</li>
            <li>Utilize its predictable lunging behavior to set traps or ambushes.</li>
            <li>Make sharp turns or find cover.</li>
            <li>Hide in the dark when possible.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Locations</h3>
          <p>Majority of Level 0</p>
