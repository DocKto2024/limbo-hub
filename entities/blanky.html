      <h2>Blanky</h2>
      <p><strong>Community Nicknames:</strong> Blanky</p>

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            Blanky is a small, passive entity known for its soft, fluffy fur that is grayish-yellow in color. 
            Its body is covered in multiple small eyes and distinct patterns, giving it a somewhat eerie appearance. 
            Blanky has eight dark, soft legs and two small light sources attached to its head, which blend into the 
            Backrooms environment, helping it avoid detection. Its yellow eyes allow for excellent vision in the dark, 
            which makes it particularly suited to its survival in the Backrooms.
          </p>

          <h3>Behavior</h3>
          <p>
            Blanky is a non-aggressive entity, more focused on avoiding danger than posing any threat. 
            It is highly skittish and will usually flee at the first sign of danger or if approached by survivors. 
            Blanky hides in dark corners or camouflages itself within the environment to stay unnoticed. 
            If it feels threatened or hunted, it moves swiftly, darting away to safety. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Although Blanky generally keeps its distance, in some rare cases, if a survivor shows no signs of aggression 
            and seems trustworthy, Blanky may cautiously approach and stay near them, seeking comfort in their presence. 
            However, this is uncommon, and most encounters involve Blanky quickly fleeing upon being spotted.
          </p>

          <h3>Countermeasures</h3>
          <p>
            Blanky poses no direct danger to survivors, as its only real defense mechanism is its ability to hide and flee. 
            Engaging Blanky in combat is unnecessary, as it cannot inflict harm. The best approach is to simply leave it alone, 
            as it will flee if pursued.
          </p>

          <h3>Moveset</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Hide:</strong> Blanky’s primary move is to hide. Upon sensing danger or noticing a survivor, Blanky will quickly dart into the shadows or dark corners, blending into the environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Eating:</strong> Blanky can take and eat food from the player, and it is also possible that he can take food directly from the player's hand.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Statistics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lethality:</strong> Blanky is harmless and poses no physical threat to survivors.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> While generally slow-moving when undisturbed, Blanky can quickly flee if it senses danger.</li>
            <li><strong>Vitality:</strong> Blanky’s body is fragile and can be easily harmed, though attacking it serves no purpose.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Known Locations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Most levels</li>
