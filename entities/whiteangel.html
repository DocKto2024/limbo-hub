      <h2>White Angel</h2>
      <p><strong>Community Nickname:</strong> White Angel</p>

      <div class="entity-description">
        <div class="entity-info">
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>The White Angel is a tall, thin and extremely fast entity. Despite its fragile and skinny appearance, its speed surpasses that of any human, making direct encounters deadly. They are usually seen crouching, "waiting" in place for prey. When alerted, they immediately rush toward their target with overwhelming speed. If they are actively searching, they may stand and walk around, though their movements remain disturbingly unnatural.</p>

          <h3>Behavior</h3>
          <p>White Angels display predatory patience, often crouching making sounds similar to sonar until someone comes close. When a target is spotted, they attack without hesitation. Survivors have reported that their gait when standing appears odd and unnatural, adding to their unsettling presence.</p>

          <h3>Combat Encounters</h3>
          <p>Killing a White Angel is possible, but extremely difficult. Survivors estimate that it takes a group of at least <strong>10–15 people armed with melee weapons</strong>, or a smaller but heavily armed team with firearms or explosive items, to bring one down. Fighting alone or with small groups is practically a death sentence.</p>

          <h3>Escape and Avoidance</h3>
          <p>Running away is not a viable option, as White Angels are much faster than any human. Hiding is sometimes possible but rarely successful, as their senses and speed often outmatch survivors' efforts. The safest and most effective method is simple: <strong>avoid them entirely</strong>.</p>

          <h3>Recommendations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Don’t fight it:</strong> Direct combat will almost always result in death.</li>
            <li><strong>Don’t search for it:</strong> Actively looking for a White Angel is suicidal.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid the sounds:</strong> Move away from the noises they emit; it is often the only warning of their presence.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Moveset</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Crouch/sitting:</strong> Mostly used in waiting phase.</li>
            <li><strong>Sprint:</strong> Can sprint toward its prey, extremely fast.</li>
            <li><strong>Teleportation:</strong> Seems to be having ability of teleportation but not enogh proofs.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Statistics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lethality:</strong> Extremely High</li>
            <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> Very Fast</li>
            <li><strong>Vitality:</strong> High (requires large groups to kill)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Known Locations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Can be found on <a href="../levels/abyss.html">Brick</a>, <a href="../404.html">Brutalist</a> and possibly their sub-levels.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Notes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Avoidance is key:</strong> Survival depends entirely on not engaging with them.</li>
            <li><strong>Noclip escape:</strong> Noclips is the best way to escape.</li>
          </ul>
