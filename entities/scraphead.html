      <h2>Scraphead</h2>
      <p><strong>Community Nicknames:</strong> Scraphead, Pipehead</p>

      <div class="entity-description">
        <div class="entity-info">
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>Scrapheads are aggressive, armless entities slightly taller than the average player. Their bodies are riddled with pipes, stabilized by bacterial wires forming their internal structure. Their most notable feature is a circular head with a large pipe embedded inside. Despite lacking arms, they are extremely dangerous, relying on their powerful legs and head for lethal attacks.</p>
          <p>They can fit through tight, player-sized spaces, giving them an edge in cramped levels.</strong>.</p>
          <p>Occasionally, Scrapheads may accidentally provoke other bacteria-based creatures by attacking them, leading to internal fights among entities.</p>

          <h3>Behavior</h3>
          <p>Scrapheads are unrelenting predators. They do not retreat once locked onto a target, continuing their assault until death. While blind, they possess extremely acute hearing, able to track players in complete darkness purely through sound. Light does not affect their behavior, making sound discipline critical to avoid detection.</p>

          <h3>Countermeasures</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Stop moving immediately if one is nearby.</li>
            <li>Create distance before attempting to hide. Then remain silent.</li>
            <li>Use dark areas to mask your presence from other entities.</li>
            <li>Make sudden, sharp turns to escape during a chase.</li>
            <li>Crouch walk to reduce noise.</li>
            <li>Trigger alarms or sound traps to mislead them.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Moveset</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Headbutt:</strong> Brutal frontal attack that deals [?] damage. Can be lethal after multiple hits.</li>
            <li><strong>Kick:</strong> Strong leg strike dealing [?] damage; can incapacitate players quickly.</li>
            <li><strong>Pounce:</strong> Charges and leaps at player. More data required.</li>
            <li><strong>Howl:</strong> Loud scream. Can attract other bacterium nearby.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Statistics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lethality:</strong> High, constant aggression and short attack cooldowns.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> Slightly slower than a sprinting player, but agile in tight spaces.</li>
            <li><strong>Vitality:</strong> Medium. Possible to kill, but difficult without teamwork.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Known Locations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Level 0:</strong> Primarily found on Level 0 and areas with higher bacterial activity, such as the Nest.</li>
            <li><strong>Level 0 sub-levels:</strong> Can enter level 0 sub-levels such <a href="../404.html">Decrement Abnormality</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Notes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Death Message:</strong> TBA</li>
            <li>Scrapheads vary slightly in structure. Some have more or fewer pipes or altered wire arrangements.</li>
          </ul>
