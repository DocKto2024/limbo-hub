      <h2>The Butcher</h2>
      <p><strong>Community Nickname:</strong> The Butcher</p>

      <div class="entity-description">
        <div class="entity-info">
          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>The Butcher is a formidable and terrifying entity, distinguished by its menacing appearance and relentless pursuit of survivors. It wears a large, well-fitted jacket in varying colors—blue, green, or red. In one hand it wields a massive, bloodstained sword named <strong>Muramasa</strong>, wrapped in ominous black cables. In the other hand, or sometimes at its hip, it carries a heavy lantern, which also doubles as a brutal melee weapon. Survivors often report hearing its sinister laughter echoing through the halls just before it strikes.</p>

          <h3>Behavior</h3>
          <p>The Butcher is sadistic and cruel, often taunting its victims before finishing them off. It enjoys fear and panic, laughing loudly when catching someone off guard. It moves with frightening speed despite its size, making escape almost impossible in open levels such as the <strong>Brutalist Level</strong>.</p>

          <h3>Weapon – Muramasa</h3>
          <p>Muramasa is a massive sword that The Butcher uses with great skill. It possesses a horrifying trait — it restores The Butcher’s health each time it kills a player or another entity. This makes The Butcher nearly impossible to kill if allowed to go on a rampage. The sword is unnaturally light for its size, enhancing its lethality.</p>

          <h3>Combat Encounters</h3>
          <p>The Butcher can be killed, but doing so is extremely difficult. Poorly planned attacks may only help it regain strength. Survivors must work in a highly coordinated group and prevent it from scoring kills, or else it may become stronger mid-battle. Entire ASYNC teams have reportedly been wiped out in single encounters. The best escape method is through noclipping, though this is not always possible.</p>

          <h3>Abilities</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sword Mastery (Muramasa):</strong> Skilled and fast attacks; heals on kill.</li>
            <li><strong>Relentless Pursuit:</strong> Chases targets with unyielding determination.</li>
            <li><strong>Mocking Laughter:</strong> Instills fear; can disorient survivors during chases.</li>
            <li><strong>Lantern Bludgeon:</strong> Secondary weapon; can deliver devastating melee blows.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Countermeasures</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Noclip Escape:</strong> Most effective method of avoiding death.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Open Levels:</strong> Don’t engage it in areas with no cover or escape routes.</li>
            <li><strong>Coordinated Assault:</strong> Only way to kill it reliably. Avoid casualties that could trigger its healing.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Statistics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lethality:</strong> Extremely High</li>
            <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> Fast and relentless</li>
            <li><strong>Vitality:</strong> High (regenerates from kills)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Known Locations</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Level 0:</strong> Rare sightings</li>
            <li><strong>Brutalist Level:</strong> Frequent and dangerous encounters</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Notes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Muramasa’s Healing:</strong> Each kill restores The Butcher’s health. Prevent this at all costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Death Message:</strong> TBA</li>
          </ul>
