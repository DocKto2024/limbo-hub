          <p><strong>Community Nicknames:</strong> Butcher</p>
          <p><strong>Danger Level:</strong> High</p>

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>The Butcher is a formidable and terrifying entity, distinguished by its menacing appearance and relentless pursuit of survivors. It is clad in a large, well-fitted jacket that comes in a range of colors—blue, green, or red. In one hand, The Butcher wields its signature weapon: a massive bloodstained sword, known as Muramasa, wrapped in ominous black cables. In its other hand, or sometimes at its hip, The Butcher carries a large lantern, which it also uses as a brutal melee weapon. Its sinister laugh echoes in the Backrooms whenever it corners or surprises a target, making encounters with this entity deeply unnerving.</p>

          <h3>Behavior</h3>
          <p>Dissectors are highly hostile and engage immediately upon sight. Their movements are quick and calculated, often employing hit-and-run tactics. However, they will disengage if they lose sight of their target, making them unpredictable.</p>

          <h3>Countermeasures</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Hide in the shadows to avoid detection.</li>
            <li>Use confined spaces to limit its movement.</li>
            <li>Take sharp turns to confuse and outrun it.</li>
            <li>Coordinate with others to flank and attack simultaneously.</li>
            <li>Wait for it to make an attack and then escape during the brief pause.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Moveset</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Slash:</strong> A fast, sharp attack dealing significant damage. Can kill an unarmored survivor in just a few hits.</li>
            <li><strong>Lunge:</strong> A sudden leap forward, attacking with both scythe-like appendages.</li>
            <li><strong>Crouch:</strong> Can crouch to fit through smaller spaces, but unable to attack while in this position.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Statistics</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Lethality:</strong> 33-70 damage per attack, depending on the move.</li>
            <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> Faster than the average survivor.</li>
            <li><strong>Vitality:</strong> Moderate health, can withstand several hits before going down.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Locations</h3>
          <p>Primarily found on Level 0 and areas with higher bacterial activity, such as the Nest.</p>

          <h3>Notes</h3>
          <p>Death Message: "TBC" — TBC.</p>
