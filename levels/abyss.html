          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            Level ❖, commonly known as <em>"The Abyss"</em> or <em>"Brick level"</em> within the survivor community, is a vast, shifting labyrinth made entirely of brick. Illumination is minimal, provided only by scattered, eerie street lamps that emit dim, flickering light, heightening the claustrophobic and foreboding atmosphere.
          </p>
          <p>
            The level's layout changes periodically, which makes navigation and mapping difficult. The oppressive silence is broken only by strange ambient noises that seem to follow the explorer, causing immense mental strain.
