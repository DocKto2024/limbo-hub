      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Level 601, also known as <em>"The End"</em>, is a small level which resembles a library. The level is small, but features in the level are the following; gramaphones on the tables, books scattered around the place, bunch of book shelves, tables/chairs, and the well known "The End" text on the wall.
      </p>
      <p>
        Level 601 has two typewriters with weird numbers coming out of it. 1 typewriter has dots and lines while the other is composed of 0's and 1's.
