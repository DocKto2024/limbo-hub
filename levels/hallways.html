          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            Sub-Level H, also referred to as <em>"Hallways"</em>, is a space consisting of seemingly infinite (but limited) narrow corridors. The design is simpler and more repetitive than Level 0, with plain walls and minimal decorations. The lighting is consistent, though dimmer than the harsh fluorescent glow of Level 0.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hallways stretch in every direction with occasional branching paths. Some areas have no lighting.

          <h3>Threats</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Other Survivors:</strong> Hostile individuals may attack for resources.</li>
            <li><strong>Entities:</strong> Butchers and Nomads may appear rarely, bacteriums can be found too via accidental noclip or when follow prey.</li>
            <li><strong>Void:</strong> The level seems to be split in two by an unreachable void. Falling into it is instantly fatal.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Entrances and exits:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Nocliping through floor in <a href="level0.html">Level 0</a> will lead you here.</li>
            <li>Two noclip points in the walls lead back to Level 0.</li>
            <li>One noclip wall leads to <a href="brutalist.html">Brutalist</a> - the main entrance to the level.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
          <p>
            Sub-Level H is a relatively safe area ideal for scavenging and regrouping. However, caution should still be exercised when interacting with other survivors.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do not attempt to cross or explore the other side of the level beyond the void — it is currently considered impossible and will lead to certain death.
