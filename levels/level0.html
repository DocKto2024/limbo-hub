      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Level 0, also known as <em>"The Infinite Hallways"</em>, is the starting point and central hub of the Backrooms. It consists of endless yellow-tinted corridors featuring stained yellow wallpaper, damp carpet, and the persistent buzz of fluorescent lighting. 
        The monotony and lack of variation cause disorientation and psychological stress.
      </p>
      <p>
        The level expands infinitely in all directions with similar rooms and hallways. Variants such as wall scratches, stains, and rare structural anomalies occur, but the overall layout remains eerily consistent.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h3>Resources</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Food:</strong> Food bars, bottled water, and various other consumables can be found.</li>
        <li><strong>Weapons:</strong> Monkey wrenches, knives, and spears may be located in scattered areas.</li>
        <li><strong>Light Sources:</strong> Placeable lamps and flashlights are commonly found, useful for navigation.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Resources are rarely clustered and typically appear at random locations.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Threats</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Entities:</strong> Bacteria-based creatures roam the hallways. Especially dangerous for lone survivors.</li>
        <li><strong>Hostile Survivors:</strong> Violent individuals may attack others near scarce resources.</li>
        <li><strong>ASYNC Operatives:</strong> While usually passive, ASYNC staff may become hostile if provoked.</li>
        <li><strong>Environment:</strong> Long-term exposure to the air may be harmful due to toxic airborne elements.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Exits</h3>
      <p>Exits are difficult to find due to the uniform nature of the level. Known exits include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>KV-31:</strong> Leads to a more industrial, hazardous environment.</li>
        <li><strong>Level 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and other:</strong> Accessible through elevators, doors, noclips; each features unique layouts.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
      <p>
        ASYNC documentation suggests Level 0 contains between 9-10 vertical floors. Exploration of vertical shafts or hidden access panels may lead to undocumented sublevels. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Breathing the air for prolonged periods may lead to nausea, hallucinations, or respiratory issues due to potential contamination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Survivors should avoid prolonged isolation and always travel equipped with light and water.
