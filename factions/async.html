    <h2>Async Corporation</h2>

    <p><strong>The Async Corporation</strong> is a research institute that originates from the Frontrooms. Their entry into the Backrooms was made possible through their <strong>KV-31 Project</strong>, which allowed them to pierce the veil into what they refer to as <em>"The Abridged Reality"</em>.</p>

    <p>While their goals remain unclear, it is believed that Async is utilizing the Backrooms as a storage and housing facility. Their outposts have grown significantly in recent months. The methods they used to enter remain undisclosed.</p>

    <p>If you encounter them, <strong>use caution</strong>. In some cases, trades are possible — they show interest in <strong>gold, silver, and placeable light sources</strong>. However, provocation may lead to confrontation.</p>
