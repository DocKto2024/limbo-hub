        <h2>Confer Entente</h2>

        <p><strong>Confer Entente</strong> is a semi-militant, survivalist collective that formed in response to the psychological decay and despair that the Backrooms inflict on wanderers. They are bound together by a shared belief in confronting fear head-on and aiding others who have lost hope.</p>

        <p>Emerging from the shadows of silent corridors and flickering lights, the Entente positions itself as a hand reaching through the void guiding the lost, empowering the weak, and uniting those ready to fight for life, not just survive it.</p>

        <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #d13737; padding-left: 10px; margin: 20px 0;">
          <em>“Bloodied hands build sturdy roads.”</em>

          <h3>Ideology & Beliefs</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Courage through unity:</strong> Fear is natural, but it must not rule us. The Entente trains its members to resist mental collapse and face danger with resolve.</li>
            <li><strong>Survival through strength:</strong> The group values physical and tactical strength, often organizing defensive drills and rescue expeditions for lost wanderers.</li>
            <li><strong>Light in darkness:</strong> Wherever they settle, they construct temporary "beacons" - brightly lit, safe rest stops filled with murals, poetry, and shared resources.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Known Structure</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Flamebearers:</strong> Leadership and ideological mentors. They keep the vision of the Entente alive through speeches, art, and philosophy.</li>
            <li><strong>Ironclads:</strong> The warriors and defenders. Ironclads maintain order, train new recruits, and repel hostile entities or intruders.</li>
            <li><strong>Whispers:</strong> Scouts and diplomats. They seek out survivors in dangerous levels and spread the Entente’s call.</li>
            <li><strong>Hands:</strong> Builders and caretakers. Responsible for maintaining outposts and gathering essential supplies.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Relations with Wanderers</h3>
          <p>
            Confer Entente is often seen as an honorable but intimidating presence. They will not hesitate to aid those in need, but they expect respect, discipline, and cooperation in return. Wanderers who disrespect the sanctity of Entente safe zones may be exiled.

          <h3>Outposts and Activity</h3>
          <p>
            Only known outpost have been confirmed in <a href="../levels/level0.html" class="button">Level 0.</a> Their bases are typically fortified with scrap barriers, posters with slogans. Reports suggest their influence continues to expand deeper into hostile zones.

          <h3>Excerpt from Manifesto</h3>
          <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #d13737; padding-left: 10px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <em>"Cowering victims of the grand monotone halls, do you fear the unknown?... Shake hands with courage and join the Confer Entente. Spread our influence across the liminal and shed a forgotten light unto the fearful."</em>
