        <p>
          <strong>The Alleycats</strong> are an independent, reclusive faction located within the mysterious and dangerous <strong>Brick Level</strong>. Unlike the chaos of Level 0 where power struggles and paranoia rule—the Alleycats have created something rare: stability.

          <h3>Who They Are</h3>
          <p>
            Formed from deserters, exiles, and those seeking a second chance, the Alleycats are bound not by rules, but by loyalty. They are considered criminals by some factions but here, in the bricks and shadows, they found peace.
          </p>

          <p>
            They do not seek control. They do not claim dominion. They survive. They build. They protect their own.
          </p>

          <h3>Philosophy</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Isolation as Strength:</strong> Separation from the wars of greater factions has allowed them to focus inward, building a life of quiet rebellion.</li>
            <li><strong>Redemption through Unity:</strong> Those society rejected are given purpose and shelter—if they prove themselves.</li>
            <li><strong>Freedom through Sacrifice:</strong> Progress is hard-won. The Alleycats respect loss and honor the fallen.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Structure</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pathfinders:</strong> Veterans who guide others into and out of Brick safely. Often seen with patched coats and red cloths tied to their arms.</li>
            <li><strong>Brickborn:</strong> Hardened defenders of the Alleycats' territory. They know every corner, and they never leave it undefended.</li>
            <li><strong>Fixers:</strong> Engineers and medics who keep their world alive—repairing systems, treating wounds, and building new life from ruins.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Relations with Other Factions</h3>
          <p>
            The Alleycats are mostly neutral. They rarely provoke, but also rarely cooperate. Trading happens, but only when it benefits them. They clashed with militaristic groups and been accused of harboring deserters but in their eyes, they are simply survivors choosing a different path.

          <h3>Final Words</h3>
          <blockquote style="border-left: 4px solid #696b6b; padding-left: 10px; margin: 20px 0;">
            <em>"Will you heed the call, or remain complicit?"</em>
