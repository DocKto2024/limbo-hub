          <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Noclip Channels</p>
          <p><strong>Type:</strong> Spatial Phenomenon / Gateway</p>

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            Noclipping is the act of passing through a solid object at high speeds, 
            most commonly used as the primary method of entering or exiting levels 
            within the Limbo. While this appears supernatural, it shares similarities 
            with quantum tunneling. Humans normally lack the energy required to 
            penetrate the boundary between the Frontrooms and the Limbo, yet in 
            rare areas where the barrier is thin enough, one may “borrow” the energy 
            of a noclip channel to phase through without breaking the wall itself.
          </p>

          <h3>Nature of Noclip Channels</h3>
          <p>
            Noclip channels are mysterious, directional forces often compared to 
            invisible wind currents. They carry impossible, potentially infinite 
            amounts of energy, pulling everything in a vacuum-like stream that 
            grows exponentially faster the longer one is caught inside. These 
            channels run through the Web Complex as well as individual levels, 
            and their destabilizing presence can result in the formation of 
            <em>Null Zones</em> or <em>Phasing Gateways</em>.
          </p>

          <h3>Behavior and Properties</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Exist in quantum amounts across the Web Complex.</li>
            <li>Pull entities or objects in a single, one-way direction.</li>
            <li>Can destabilize reality when misaligned, creating anomalies.</li>
            <li>Act as the “currents” that connect one level to another.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Frontrooms Connection</h3>
          <p>
            It is theorized that noclip channels exist in the Frontrooms as well, 
            but only at the molecular scale. The initial entrance to the Backrooms 
            is thought to be a massive, abnormally strong channel linking both 
            realities. Since channels are one-way by nature, it explains why 
            returning to the Frontrooms from Level 0 is considered impossible.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, with infinite levels comes the possibility of infinite channels — 
            suggesting that far enough into the Limbo, a pathway back may exist. 
            Such channels might be too unstable, temporary, or narrow to travel, 
            making them unreliable and extremely dangerous to attempt.
          </p>

            Noclip Channel captured during a phasing event in Level 1.
