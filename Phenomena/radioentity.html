      <h2>Radio Disturbance ("Radio Entity")</h2>
      <div class="creature-description">
        <div class="level-info">
          <p><strong>Common Name:</strong> Radio Entity</p>
          <p><strong>Type:</strong> Invasive Phenomenon / Sentient Collective</p>

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>The Radio Disturbance, colloquially called the “Radio Entity,” is an anomalous collective presence that hijacks radio frequencies during key moments or seemingly at random. It communicates through distorted voices, cryptic messages, and impersonations. Prolonged interactions cause the messages to become increasingly incomprehensible, deviating from speech to metaphor.</p>

          <p>It often refers to itself as "we," indicating a shared consciousness. This collective exhibits signs of omniscience — knowing sensitive player and entity data, full names, and even accessing real-time voice conversations, suggesting a deep and painful connection to the Backrooms' structure itself.</p>

          <h3>Known Behaviors</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Impersonates known individuals to deceive or mislead.</li>
            <li>Provides misleading or cryptic directions.</li>
            <li>Summons or places down objects like milk cartons or lights without a trace.</li>
            <li>Manipulates radio devices simultaneously with different outputs.</li>
            <li>Moves mannequins, chairs, and objects while unobserved.</li>
            <li>Flickers fluorescent lights and emits untraceable screeches.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Rare Events</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Delivers lore-relevant ARG puzzles.</li>
            <li>Places Pale Keys in areas like the Motel Depot.</li>
            <li>Mentions real names and secrets of major lore figures.</li>
            <li>Opens gates and interacts with heavy machinery.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Theories</h3>
          <p>Speculated origin ties to a cataclysmic event in Level 11. A former community may have suffered a horrific fate, resulting in their consciousnesses merging into a collective now trapped in a Radio Tower-like anomaly. The Radio Entity may be involuntarily awakened by radio activity, experiencing severe mental strain as a result.</p>

            <em>“You hearing us hurts more than you can fantasize.”</em>
          </blockquote>

          <h3>Possible Countermeasures</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Limit radio usage in unstable zones.</li>
            <li>Avoid responding directly to unknown transmissions.</li>
            <li>Recognize and ignore voice mimicry attempts.</li>
            <li>Mark zones with known interference to warn others.</li>
          </ul>
